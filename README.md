## BattleTank
****

An open-world Tank fight with simple AI, terrain and advanced control systems in Unreal 4

## Future Concept -  Tankformers
In a world where tanks have evolved to have various shapes and sizes, they have reached the pinacle of evolution by achieving the ability to shift forms into a humanoid shape to reach faster speeds, climb untankable locales, and lay siege upon the enemy like never before. This is an increased amount that meets the oculurs. 

*ahem*
So anyway, this will be a tank arena battler with 3 basic tank types: Light, Medium and Heavy. There will be a bar that fills up as the player kills or gets damaged that will allow the tanks to 'Tankform' and each tank type results in a different 'Tankformation'. For example, the Light tank tankforms to a more slim and agile humanoid form (akin to a Kunoichi, perhaps) while the Heavy tank tankforms to a heavy set warrior that detaches the cannon from its back and holds it at the barrel like a large warhammer. They can only be Tankformed for as long as the Tankform bar allows.

The game is over when all enemies are defeated (for starters anyway), but I would like 2 modes:-

Mission mode where the goal is to kill enemies until a certain score is reached

Survival mode where the goal is to last as long as possible.
